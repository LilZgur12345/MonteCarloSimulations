1) Dice Roll - Sum Probabilities
    - Which sum (16 or 20) is more likely when you roll 5 dice

2) Truth-telling or Lying Friends
    - What is the probability that at least one friend is lying

3) Route Distances (with random events)
    - Is it shorter to travel from Nashville or Atlanta on average

4) Normal Distribution Probability
    - What is the probability that a value from this normal distribution falls between -1 and 2
